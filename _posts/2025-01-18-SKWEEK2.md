## Our Direction

After the first team discussion, we have decided to prioritize the implementation of a backtesting platform. This decision stems from our understanding that creating a robust backtesting framework is critical for testing various technical analysis strategies. Such a platform will also pave the way for integrating machine learning models to enhance strategy development and evaluation.

## Libraries for Backtesting and Trading Strategies

To identify the best tools for our purpose, we researched several Python libraries and their features. Below are the key libraries we considered:

1. **Backtesting.py**  
   - A user-friendly library specifically designed for developing and testing trading strategies.
   - Offers simple integration with technical indicators and visualization tools.
   - Highly customizable, making it suitable for both novice and advanced users.

2. **TA-Lib**  
   - Provides a wide range of technical analysis indicators.
   - Efficient for large-scale computations and backtesting due to its C-based implementation.
   - Compatible with various data sources and formats.

3. **Pandas and NumPy**  
   - Though not specialized for backtesting, these libraries are excellent for custom data manipulation and analysis.
   - Useful for preprocessing and augmenting data for machine learning models.

4. **TA (ta.py)**  
   - Built on top of Pandas, this library simplifies the computation of popular technical indicators.
   - Integrates seamlessly with existing data workflows.

5. **Zipline**  
   - A more comprehensive library designed for backtesting and live trading.
   - Strong integration with data feeds but may be more complex to set up compared to other tools.

## Machine Learning Techniques for Backtesting

To extend our analysis beyond traditional strategies, we aim to incorporate machine learning. The following methods show promise for backtesting and predictive modeling:

1. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**  
   - A type of recurrent neural network well-suited for sequence prediction.
   - Effective for capturing temporal dependencies in stock price data.

2. **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**  
   - Similar to LSTM but with a simpler architecture, making it less computationally expensive.
   - Suitable for scenarios where model training time is a concern.

3. **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)**  
   - A statistical approach for time series analysis and forecasting.
   - Useful for baseline predictions and comparison with machine learning models.

4. **Random Forests and Gradient Boosting**  
   - Non-linear ensemble methods that can handle complex relationships in data.
   - Effective for feature selection and prediction when combined with technical indicators.

5. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
   - An advanced approach for learning optimal trading policies through trial and error.
   - Requires substantial computational resources but offers high adaptability to dynamic markets.

## Next Steps

1. **Platform Development**: 
   - Begin by building a backtesting platform using `Backtesting.py` for simplicity and flexibility.
   - Integrate `ta.py` for technical indicator computation.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Collect and preprocess historical market data for testing and validation.

3. **Strategy Testing**:
   - Implement initial technical analysis strategies and evaluate their performance using the backtesting platform.

4. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Introduce LSTM and GRU models for predictive analysis.
   - Compare results with traditional statistical approaches like ARIMA.

5. **Iterative Improvements**:
   - Refine strategies based on backtesting results.
   - Gradually integrate reinforcement learning for adaptive trading strategies.

By focusing on these steps, we aim to establish a comprehensive framework that combines the strengths of traditional backtesting with advanced machine learning techniques, ultimately leading to better-informed trading decisions.
