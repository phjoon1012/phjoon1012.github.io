## Team Decisions and Direction

As the team leader, I took the responsibility of narrowing down the specifics of our product. After thorough discussions, we reached a pivotal conclusion: instead of trading multiple coins and analyzing which one performs the best, we will focus on a single cryptocurrency and refine strategies for that coin. This decision is based on the following reasons:

**Depth Over Breadth**: Concentrating on one coin allows us to gain a deeper understanding of its behavior, patterns, and market dynamics.

**Resource Optimization**: Focusing on a single coin ensures efficient use of our computational and human resources.

**Clear Benchmarking**: Having a single coin simplifies performance evaluation and helps us develop more robust strategies.

## Strategy Implementation and Progress

I personally worked on implementing a set of sample strategies to showcase the platformâ€™s potential. These include:

   - RSI (Relative Strength Index)

   - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

  - EMA (Exponential Moving Average)

To make our progress visible and accessible, I uploaded these strategies to a Streamlit application. This allows our team to:

* View backtesting results in real-time.

* Evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies.

* Discuss improvements and potential integrations.

## Streamlit Interface

### The Streamlit application features:

**Strategy Selection**: Choose between RSI, MACD, and EMA.

**Backtesting Results**: Visual representation of strategy performance over historical data.

**Parameter Adjustments**: Modify key parameters (e.g., time periods) to observe their impact.

### Python Code Example

Below is a snippet of the RSI strategy implementation for reference:


## Next Steps

**Finalize Coin Selection**: Decide which cryptocurrency to focus on based on team discussions and market research.

**Strategy Refinement**: Enhance existing strategies and introduce new ones.

**Machine Learning Integration**: Begin integrating predictive models like LSTM for more adaptive strategies.

**Collaborative Reviews**: Use the Streamlit app for iterative feedback and improvements.

By aligning our efforts with these priorities, we aim to create a streamlined and effective algorithmic trading platform.
